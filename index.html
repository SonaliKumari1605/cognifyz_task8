            <p class="solar-defination">The Solar System is a system of a Sun and the objects that move around it. Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun and everything bound to it by gravity - the planets like the Earth, asteroids, meteors, comets and many more.</p>

        <h3 class="Sun">Sun</h3>
        <p class="sun-def">The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated by energy produced by nuclear fusion reactions at its core. Part of this energy is emitted from its surface as visible light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, providing most of the energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central subject for astronomical research since antiquity.</p>

        <div class="mercury1">
            <h3 class="mercuryhead">Mercury</h3> 
            <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It's just a little bigger than Earth's Moon. Mercury itself, though, doesn't have any moons. It is the closest planet to the Sun, but it's actually not the hottest. <br>Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface that is covered with craters. Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off the surface by the solar wind and striking meteoroids. Mercury's exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. Mercury doesn’t have any moons.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="venus1">
            <h3 class="venushead">Venus</h3>
            <p>Even though Venus isn't the closest planet to the Sun, it is still the hottest. It has a thick atmosphere full of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and clouds made of sulfuric acid. The gas traps heat and keeps Venus toasty warm. In fact, it's so hot on Venus, metals like lead would be puddles of melted liquid. <br>Venus looks like a very active planet. It has mountains and volcanoes. Venus is similar in size to Earth. Earth is just a little bit bigger.

                Venus is unusual because it spins the opposite direction of Earth and most other planets. And its rotation is very slow. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="earth1">
            <h3 class="earthead">Earth</h3>
            <p>Our home planet Earth is a rocky, terrestrial planet. It has a solid and active surface with mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. Earth is special because it is an ocean planet. Water covers 70% of Earth's surface. <br>Our atmosphere is made mostly of nitrogen and has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe. The atmosphere also protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up in our atmosphere before they can strike the surface as meteorites.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mars1">
            <h3 class="marshead">Mars</h3>
            <p>Mars is a cold desert world. The average temperature on Mars is minus 85 degrees Fahrenheit – way below freezing. It is half the size of Earth. Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet. It's red because of rusty iron in the ground. <br>Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon. People would not be able to breathe the air on Mars.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jupiter1">
            <h3 class="jupiterhead">Jupiter</h3>
            <p>Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's similar to a star, but it never got massive enough to start burning. It is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been going for hundreds of years. Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface. It is still unclear if deeper down, Jupiter has a central core of solid material or if it may be a thick, super-hot and dense soup. <br> Jupiter also has rings, but they're too faint to see very well.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="saturn1">
            <h3 class="saturnhead">Saturn</h3>
            <p>Saturn isn’t the only planet to have rings, but it definitely has the most beautiful ones. The rings we see are made of groups of tiny ringlets that surround Saturn. They’re made of chunks of ice and rock. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly a ball of hydrogen and helium. <br>When Galileo Galilei saw Saturn through a telescope in the 1600s, he wasn't sure what he was seeing. At first he thought he was looking at three planets, or a planet with handles. Now we know those "handles" turned out to be the rings of Saturn.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="uranus1">
            <h3 class="uranushead">Uranus</h3>
            <p>Uranus is made of water, methane, and ammonia fluids above a small rocky center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen and helium like Jupiter and Saturn, but it also has methane. The methane makes Uranus blue. <br>Uranus also has faint rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark. The outer rings are brightly colored and easier to see. Like Venus, Uranus rotates in the opposite direction as most other planets. And unlike any other planet, Uranus rotates on its side.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="neptune1">
            <h3 class="neptunehead">Neptune</h3>
            <p>Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy. It's the last of the planets in our solar system. It's more than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth is. Neptune is very similar to Uranus. <br>It's made of a thick fog of water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The methane gives Neptune the same blue color as Uranus. Neptune has six rings, but they're very hard to see.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="moon">
            <h3 class="moonhead">Moon</h3>
            <p>The Moon is a large natural object that orbits, or travels around, Earth. After the Sun it is the brightest object in the sky. The average distance between the Moon and Earth is about 238,900 miles (384,400 kilometers). Compared to the distance between other planets and Earth, this distance is small.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="star">
            <h3 class="starhead">Stars</h3>
            <p>Stars are giant balls of hot gases that can produce their own light. Stars give out energy by converting Hydrogen gas into Helium in their cores. Stars are gigantic in size and have an immense gravitational attraction. The sun is a medium-sized star that gives us energy and makes life possible on earth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="comet">
            <h3 class="comethead">Comets</h3>
            <p>These are small chunks of ice and rock that come from the outer edge of the solar system. When its orbit brings it closer to the sun, the ice on them vaporizes, creating a beautiful tail behind them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="asteroid">
            <h3 class="asteroidhead">Asteroids</h3>
            <p>These are small irregularly shaped rocks made up of metal or minerals that orbit the sun. Most of them are found between Mars and Jupiter in an area known as the asteroid belt.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="meteors">
            <h3 class="meteorhead">Meteors and meteorites</h3>
            <p>These are objects from space that enter our atmosphere as they are pulled by the earth’s gravity. Meteors usually are small and burn up in the atmosphere as they enter the earth. This creates streaks in the sky as though a star has fallen. They are commonly called shooting stars. If a meteor is large enough it can reach the ground and create a crater. Such objects are called meteorites.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="galaxy">
            <h3 class="galaxyhead">Galaxies</h3>
            <p>Galaxies are large groups of stars held together by gravity. The sun and the solar system are a part of a galaxy known as the Milky Way. Other galaxies are usually so far away that they look like stars in the night sky. The Andromeda galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud are galaxies that can be seen with the naked eye on a clear night.</p>
